## 简介

Zenject is a lightweight dependency injection framework built specifically to target Unity 3D (however it can be used outside of Unity as well).  It can be used to turn your application into a collection of loosely-coupled parts with highly segmented responsibilities.  Zenject can then glue the parts together in many different configurations to allow you to easily write, re-use, refactor and test your code in a scalable and extremely flexible way.
